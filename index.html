        <p>Hi there! I’m Elen. <br>
            I started my journey with web developing/designing at the young age of 13 on MySpace. It was there that I offered customized layouts to all the emo and goth kids. That’s where I learned that I like making things look awesome. When I was 16, I moved back to my birthtown of São Paulo. I had grown up in the US since I was 4. I speak both English and Portuguese fluently and I am learning French. 
            I like creating designs that use color and space in creative ways and bring practicality in their experience. I like thinking outside of the box and looking for solutions that maybe someone else never thought about. 
            <br><br>
            I think that my personal touch to everything that I do is making sure all my creations are intuitive.  I understand that my duty as a designer is to create powerful communication and maintain a professional attitude.<br>
            <br><br>
            My previous work experience was as Project Manager, Support Level 2 and some programming for a edu-tech company. I worked there for almost 2 years. 
            <br><br>
            Before that, I had worked as an ESL teacher, where I learned many, many special skills as a leader, teammate and as a human. I worked in classrooms for over 10 years. 
            <br><br>
            I am graduating in Systems Analysis and Development in early 2023. <br>
            I am a self learner, so all of my skills I learned collaborating with other designers and developers and I have many Udemy Certificates as well. </p>
